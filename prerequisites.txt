# smart-pinhole-workshop Pre-requisites

Tested with node.js v0.12. You may have problems with v4 and native modules.

Flash your Arduino with Standard Firmata:

1 - Connect the Arduino UNO to your PC using the USB Cable
2 - Open the Arduino IDE, select: File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
3 - Click the "Upload" button.
4 - The text "Done Uploading" will appear once the upload is complete.

Having problems? Perhaps adjust one of the following.

* Select : Tools > Board and ensure that "Arduino UNO" is selected.
* Select : Tools > Serial Port and select another serial port.
    ** On a Mac the correct port may look like "/dev/tty.usbmodem:1411" or "/dev/cu.usbmodem:1411".
* Check the USB Cable is connected - consider also trying a different cable.
* You can also try pressing the Reset Button on the UNO.

They try the upload process one more time.
