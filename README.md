**A [nodeschool][1] type workshop to create an IoT Smart Pinhole Camera**

```shell
# Install
npm install -g smart-pinhole-workshop
# Run
smart-pinhole-workshop
```

Learn __core Internet of Things__ principles by hacking a [__Pinhole Camera__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera).

Our Camera will sense brightness. And, inform us of the optimal film exposure time for a photo.

**The workshop will pose a challenge, and test your solution.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.``

You need an `Arduino UNO` and a `Pinhole Camera` for creating a real `Smart` Camera.

## Code style

To move towards a consistent style for nodeschool projects we use the .jshintrc
as defined in learnyounode: https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode/blob/master/.jshintrc

Your favourite jshint runner will work. And, a gulpfile is provided.

```shell
npm install -g gulp
gulp
```
