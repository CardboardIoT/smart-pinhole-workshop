# Welcome to the smart-pinhole-workshop

Let's learn ```core Internet of Things``` principles by hacking a ```Pinhole Camera```.

Our smart Pinhole Hole Camera senses room brightness. This lets us know the correct film exposure time for taking a photo.

We are going to cover:
* Messaging with MQTT ... this is the backbone for any IOT installation.
* Smartening your Thing with sensors and publishing data.
* Connecting a real time UI to inform actions based on smart sensor data.
