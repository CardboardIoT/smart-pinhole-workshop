# Welcome to the smart-pinhole-workshop

Let's learn ```core Internet of Things``` principles by hacking a ```Pinhole Camera```.

Our Camera will sense brightness. And, inform us of the optimal film exposure time for a photo.

**The workshop will pose a challenge, and test your solution.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.``

You need an `Arduino UNO` and a `Pinhole Camera` for creating a real `Smart` Camera.
